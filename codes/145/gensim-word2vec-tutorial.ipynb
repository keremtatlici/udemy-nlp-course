A python native, I naturally decided to focus on Gensim's implementation of Word2Vec, and went on to look for tutorials on the web. As all good data scientists, I directly applied and reproduced the code samples from multiple website. Confused and often disappointed by the results I got, I went deeper and deeper, from stackoverflow threads, to Gensim's Google Groups, onto the documentation of the library, to try and understand what went wrong in my approach. After weeks of hard labor, I finally managed to get decent results, but I was frustrated by these online tutorials which were, for the most part, misleading.\n","\n","What troubled me the most in these online tutorials was their mismanagement of the model training: the code worked, and I got results which appeared to be decent at first, but the more I looked into them, the more disturbing they were. I wasted a lot of time figuring out what was wrong.\n","\n","Another issue I had with these tutorials was the data preparation step: too often, the authors chose to load an existing preprocessed dataset, use a toy example or skip this part. However, I always thought that one of the most important parts of the creation of a Word2Vec model was then missing. During my experimentations, I noticed that lemmatizing the sentences or looking for phrases/bigrams in them had a big impact over the results and performance of my models. Though the influence of the preprocessing varies with each dataset and application, I thought I would include the data preparation steps in this tutorial and use the great spaCy library along with it.\n","\n","I am not the only one annoyed by some of these [issues](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/gensim/jom4JFt7EV8/y5fjhupbAgAJ), so I decided to write my own tutorial.\n","\n","I do not pledge that it is perfect, nor the best way to implement Word2Vec, simply that it is better than a good chunk of what is out there ðŸ˜‰"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_uuid":"aa10f4823faa729e96f15bb865e9f20769ea7a4b"},"source":["# Plan\n","\n","1.

I am simply going to give a very brief explanation, and provide you with links to good, in depth tutorials.\n","\n","## Brief explanation:\n","\n","Word2Vec was introduced in two [papers](#Material-for-more-in-depths-understanding:) between September and October 2013, by a team of researchers at Google. Along with the papers, the researchers published their implementation in C. The Python implementation was done soon after the 1st paper, by [Gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/index.html). \n","\n","The underlying assumption of Word2Vec is that two words sharing similar contexts also share a similar meaning and consequently a similar vector representation from the model. For instance: \"dog\", \"puppy\" and \"pup\" are often used in similar situations, with similar surrounding words like \"good\", \"fluffy\" or \"cute\", and according to Word2Vec they will therefore share a similar vector representation.<br>\n","\n","From this assumption, Word2Vec can be used to find out the relations between words in a dataset, compute the similarity between them, or use the vector representation of those words as input for other applications such as text classification or clustering.\n","\n","# Getting Started\n","\n","## Setting up the environment:\n","\n","`python==3.6.3`\n","\n","Libraries used:\n"," * `xlrd==1.1.0`: https://pypi.org/project/xlrd/\n"," * `spaCy==2.0.12`: https://spacy.io/usage/\n"," * `gensim==3.4.0`: https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/install.html\n"," * `scikit-learn==0.19.1`: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html\n"," * `seaborn==0.8`: https://seaborn.pydata.org/installing.html"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"_uuid":"cc7b3e6ca62670ff13626705402f626778487204","trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["import re  # For preprocessing\n","import pandas as pd  # For data handling\n","from time import time  # To time our operations\n","from collections import defaultdict  # For word frequency\n","\n","import spacy  # For preprocessing\n","\n","import logging  # Setting up the loggings to monitor gensim\n","logging.basicConfig(format=\"%(levelname)s - %(asctime)s: %(message)s\", datefmt= '%H:%M:%S', level=logging.INFO)\n","\n","dataset_path = '../../datasets/simpsons_dataset.csv'"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_uuid":"8ec7ce784f6d9e7f71e2b5789b1e65ec4414628b"},"source":["<img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/44/Logo_The_Simpsons.svg\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"400\"/>\n","\n","## The data:\n","I chose to play with the script from the Simpsons, both because I love the Simpsons and because with more than 150k lines of dialogues, the dataset was substantial!\n","\n","This dataset contains the characters, locations, episode details, and script lines for approximately 600 Simpsons episodes, dating back to 1989.
